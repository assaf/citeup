                CiteUp started with a question we couldn't answer: when someone
                asks Claude or ChatGPT about our space, do they mention us? The
                answer mattered — AI platforms are increasingly where people
                discover products and services — but there was no easy way to
                find out.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2026, we built the tool we needed: run your search queries
                across every major AI platform, record exactly which URLs appear
                in responses, and show you the trend over time. No guessing, no
                manual spot-checking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we're making it available to any brand that wants to
                understand and improve their presence in AI-generated answers.
